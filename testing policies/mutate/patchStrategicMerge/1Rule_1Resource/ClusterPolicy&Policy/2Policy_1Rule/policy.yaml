      The nodeSelector field uses labels to select the node on which a Pod can be scheduled.
      This can be useful when Pods have specific needs that only certain nodes in a cluster can provide.
      This policy adds the nodeSelector field to a Pod spec and configures it with labels `foo` and `color`.
